Customer churn is a phenomenon for a myriad of industries including travel,media and streaming service companies.
The churn rate for certain industries is concerningly high. In America 2020, financial and retail sectors had the highest churn rates of
25% and 24% respectively(1). In contrast, the IT and software industry had the highest retention rate(81%)(1). The expense to 
pursue new customers who may or may not be interested is less appealing than spending effort in retaining long term customers.As one 
research survey puts it,"putting efforts to increase the retention rate of all customers in terms of CRM is less efficient than putting
efforts on a small number of targeted customer acquisition activities"(2). Thus,it would be appropriate for a company to focus its 
resources on key customers who can contribute towards the highest profit return. Having said that, the ability to predict, which 
customer is likely to churn is immensely beneficial for industries. This is the objective behind this project. The project aims to build
a machine learning model which can predict the churn of customers based on certain factors.
